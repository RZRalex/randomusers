# randomusers
An API and AJAX implemented webpage full of random users 
from the DB  randomuser.me

This app uses content from a random user API to populate the webpage with 20 random users from the database.
When the ajax call is recieved, the js parses through the data to select the needed information and inserts 
the data into a bootstrap card that is then appended into the html for display. 
At the bottom of the page is a table where similar information is pulled and inserted into a table format.

Along with API and Ajax, and bootstrap tools, this project also uses jQuery and Javascript to operate
through the data.
